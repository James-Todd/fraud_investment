# AABR_fraud_investment
Repository of models underlying a working paper exploring the alternative evaluation of financial statement fraud detection models. This repository contains five models trained to predict fraud, all five of which are used as part of an ensemble based on a simple averaging of predictions. The underlying data inside of these models has been removed as it was originally extracted from Bloomberg and Capital IQ.
